The channel returned for a while three years ago, but after posting nine videos, it went into hiatus again and hasn't been updated.</p><h2>What Happened To BdoubleO100's Third Daughter?</h2><p>Sadly, the Minecraft <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTuber</a> BdoubleO100 and Nicole Booko's third daughter could not make it to life.</p><p>Ivy Rose was born on January 12, 2018, but passed away eighteen hours later due to a genetic condition called Trisomy 13.</p><p>Trisomy 13, or Patau Syndrome, is a chromosomal abnormality where some or all of the body's cells contain extra genetic material from chromosome 13, thus the name.&nbsp;</p><p>The extra genetic material from chromosome 13 disrupts normal development and causes multiple complex organ defects that eventually cause loss of life.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-is-bdoubleo100-real->What Is BdoubleO100's Real Name?</h2><p>BdoubleO100's real name is<strong> John Booko</strong>, and he has been on YouTube since 2011.</p><p>Before YouTube, Booko worked as a general contractor at his family-run company, Booko Brothers Inc, for eight years.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/43b6018a-f6cf-486d-bde1-4d216f84566e.webp></p><p>The contractor business is still active and has two offices. One in Three Rivers and the other in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They proudly represent West Michigan and aim to be the best general contractor service possible in all of West Michigan.</p><p>Within a year of doing Youtube, Booko left his contractor job and started doing Youtube. Since then, he has been a dedicated member of Minecraft Youtube.</p><p>He has a younger brother, Joe, also a Youtuber named Pungence, best known for his Amazing Frog gameplay videos.</p><h2>More About Pungence, BdoubleO100's Brother</h2><p>BdoubleO100's brother <strong>Pungence </strong>joined Youtube a couple of months before, on November 3, 2010.</p><p>However, his first video was after his brother, on September 6, 2011. Since then, he has amassed 2.55 million subscribers, a little over half a million more than his brother, and uploaded 3,027 videos on his channel. The most popular video on his channel has amassed 16 million views. Of the 3,027 videos on the Pungence channel, 352 have reached or surpassed a million views.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/c03cbd2e-85e7-41e4-bde0-2a2d888468e6.webp></p><p>As mentioned above, Pungence is primarily known for his Amazing Frog gameplay, but unlike his brother, Pungence has diversified his channel to have videos from different games.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides Amazing Frog, he provides gameplay of the following video games:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Feed and Grow Fish</li><li>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</li><li>Lego Worlds&nbsp;</li><li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</li><li>Clone Drone in the Danger Zone</li></ul><p>BdoubleO100 and Pungence also have a younger sister, Abigail, a cosmetologist.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is BDoubleO100's Age?</h2><p>BDoubleO100 was born on October 12, 1982, and is 39 years old.</p><p>He was born and raised in Michigan, where he currently resides. Not much is known about his early life.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/090d217f-11c8-4e1c-9adb-ea1d11a47f58.webp></p><p>As mentioned above, BDoubleO100 has been active on Youtube since 2011. He joined the website on April 20, 2011, and uploaded his first video the same day.&nbsp;</p><p>His early videos were about different builds that one could do in the game. Eleven years later, the Minecraft Youtuber commands entire servers, makes villages, and hosts Open Mic nights within the game.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Look At BDoubleO100's YouTube Career: Mindcrack</h2><p>One of the reasons why BdoubleO100 grew rapidly on Youtube during his early days was by joining Mindcrack.</p><p>Mindcrack is a group of prominent content creators that publish footage of their video gaming experience online. It started as a Minecraft-oriented server but has since become something much larger.&nbsp;</p><p>BdoubleO100 joined the server back in September 2011. He was invited to join the server by fellow Youtuber Guude, who now goes by GuudeBoulderfist.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/1f8109b5-4e85-47b5-ab63-f7ecc6f89dfe.webp></p><p>BdoubleO100 was a member of the Mindcrack server for four years until the server dismissed him on April 3, 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a statement released by the Youtuber, he parted ways with the server due to legal changes within the brand that made it so that he was not allowed to be an official member anymore. His dismissal caused some uproar against the server, which has since lessened.</p><h2>A Look At BDoubleO100's YouTube Career: Hermitcraft</h2><p>After his dismissal from Mindcrafk, BdoubleO100 joined the Hermitcraft server in April 2017.</p><p>Hermitcraft is a Minecraft server made up of popular Minecraft-related content creators who post Youtuber videos or Twitch streams about the server. These creators are called Hermits.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/9797efa3-0f9b-4707-acb4-840f2745ab41.webp></p><p>As of the writing of this article, there are 26 safe-listed Hermits, 23 of whom are active, while three are inactive.</p><p>The active Hermits are as follows:</p><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:100% border=1><tbody><tr><td><strong>Channel Name</strong></td><td><strong>YouTube Subscribers</strong></td></tr><tr><td>BdoubleO100</td><td>1,850,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cubfan135</td><td>832,000</td></tr><tr><td>Docm77</td><td>1,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>EthosLab</td><td>2,430,000</td></tr><tr><td>FalseSymmetry</td><td>454,000</td></tr><tr><td>GeminiTay</td><td>1,520,000</td></tr><tr><td>GoodTimesWithScar</td><td>1,940,000</td></tr><tr><td>Grian</td><td>7,890,000</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnotizd</td><td>391,000</td></tr><tr><td>iJevin</td><td>797,000</td></tr><tr><td>ImpulseSV</td><td>1,190,000</td></tr><tr><td>Iskall85</td><td>1,660,000</td></tr><tr><td>JoeHills</td><td>157,000</td></tr><tr><td>Keralis</td><td>2,360,000</td></tr><tr><td>PearlescentMoon</td><td>651,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rendog</td><td>685,000</td></tr><tr><td>StressMonster101</td><td>343,000</td></tr><tr><td>TangoTek</td><td>1,070,000</td></tr><tr><td>VintageBeef</td><td>1,570,000</td></tr><tr><td>xBCrafted</td><td>382,000</td></tr><tr><td>Xisumavoid</td><td>1,800,000</td></tr><tr><td>ZedaphPlays</td><td>287,000</td></tr><tr><td>ZombieCleo</td><td>308,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The inactive Hermits are as follows:&nbsp;</p><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;height:89.5624px border=1><tbody><tr style=height:22.3906px><td style=height:22.3906px><strong>Channel Name</strong></td><td style=height:22.3906px><strong>YouTube Subscribers&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=height:22.3906px><strong>Reason for Inactivity</strong></td></tr><tr style=height:44.7812px><td style=height:44.7812px>MumboJumbo</td><td style=height:44.7812px>8,540,000</td><td style=height:44.7812px>Taking a break from YouTube</td></tr><tr style=height:22.3906px><td style=height:22.3906px>Welsknight</td><td style=height:22.3906px>550,000</td><td style=height:22.3906px>Might be busy in real life</td></tr><tr><td>TinFoilChef</td><td>125,000</td><td>Deceased</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=how-much-is-bdoubleo100-n>How Much Is BdoubleO100's Net Worth?</h2><p>The Minecraft YouTuber BdoubleO100 has an estimated net worth of <strong>$500,000 </strong>as of 2022.</p><p>He makes his income primarily from his Youtube account, which, as mentioned above, has been active since 2011.

However, since the unfortunate birth circumstances of his third daughter, his children have not been a focal point of his channel. Almost all of the videos on this channel have to do with the new Hermitcraft season.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides his main channel, BdoubleO100 has two side channels that are both inactive. The first is the BdoubleOLive, which has 128K subscribers, and BDUBSwithCHESSE, which has 36.1K subscribers.&nbsp;</p><p>The former hasn't been active in three years, and the latter hasn't been active in five years.</p><h2>How Does BdoubleO100 Make Money?</h2><p>Like most other Youtubers, BdoubleO100 makes money through his channel's views, sponsorship deals, and Patreon account.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube </a>pays its UK, US, and Canadian creators $2 - $12 per 1000 monetized views after taking its cut. This money comes from AdSense, the Ads that Youtube runs on its videos.</p><p>The longer a viewer stays on a video, the more money the creator makes. Supposing that BdoubleO100's videos retain a large portion of the total views he has received on his main channel, which is 446,968,145, he has made roughly $5,363,617 from his main channel.</p><p>Using the same metric on his other channels, the Youtuber has made $245,343 from the total views BdoubleOLive has amassed and $8,754 from the 729,566 total views BDUBSwithCheese has amassed.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/50265999-972b-4e5f-b0d0-bc86e0be7e77.webp></p><p>There's also his Patreon page. Patreon is a website where people can support their favorite content creators by sending them monthly donations.</p><p>Most people with a Patron account have tiers where people are given certain benefits depending on which tier they are a part of. BdoubleO100 is no difference.</p><p>However, what makes him different is that while most accounts have three tiers, he only has two. They are:</p><ul><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> $5 per Month: Bdubs Resource Pack Downloads<ul><li>The member gets access to the Bdubs Minecraft Resource Pack</li></ul></li><li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> $20 per month: Bdubs Servers<ul><li>The member gets access to a Patreon-only Minecraft server</li><li>They will be provided with a private community chat where BdoubleO100 will be active</li><li>They will get all the perks of the lower tier</li></ul></li></ul><h2>How Much Is BdoubleO100's Career Earnings?</h2><p>Counting by the money he has made from the total views on his three channels, BdoubleO100's career earnings are $5,617,714.</p><p>However, this amount is only counting his views. There is also his Patreon, where he has 264 patrons through whom he makes $1,426 per month.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/c8b62c87-5455-4a83-9e8b-c924ada932cc.webp></p><p>He has had his Patreon since 2015, but it's impossible to know how much his monthly income has been during the seven years. If one assumes there have been at least a thousand dollars a month during that time, then his career earnings through Patreon alone have been $84,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Combined with his career earnings from his <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube videos,</a> his total career earnings come to $5,701,714.
