It is yet another mostly forgettable genre film that has been Willis’ <a href=#>stock in trade since 2011</a>. He released eight of these in 2021 alone, a feat that <a href=#>the Razzie Awards noted</a> with its new category, Worst Performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 Movie. A good Bruce line delivery here, a standout supporting performance there, and some WTF casting (see: Shannon Doherty as a general in The Fortress) make these serviceable diversions, but with each one, the career highs of Die Hard and The Sixth Sense are but dimmer and dimmer memories. Most are distinguished by the ingenious ways the producers hide that Bruce was only available for a limited time (reportedly only a day in several cases) and eke out roughly 10 minutes of screen time per picture. Since this ranking was last revised this past September, five more have been released. None are doing his legacy any favors. As someone remarks in Apex, “He used to be something great, but he’s at the end of his rope now.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckfzkyo0i000i3h67jh4ikc84@published data-word-count=52>At this point, these films are almost their own genre. Ye shall know them by their generic titles and judicious use of Bruce, whose total screen time in each rarely surpasses 15 minutes. But Bruce puts asses on the couch, so he is prominently featured in the trailers and on the posters.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckfzkyo8p000k3h67kutup0b0@published data-word-count=51>Reviews of these films tend to be&nbsp;<a href=#>scathing</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>snide</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>snarky</a>&nbsp;(and those are just the&nbsp;S’s) and have been the subject of&nbsp;<a href=#>think pieces</a>&nbsp;(well, not so much think pieces as WTF pieces) that ponder variations on the theme: Why does one of the once biggest action stars in the world keep turning up in this dreck?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckfzkyolj000m3h67quy63ob5@published data-word-count=51>But why ask why?

Enjoy them, if you dare.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cktommxiu000w3g702dcr6axc@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>27.

His less than eight minutes of screen time are devoted to generic straight lines (“This is gonna be bad”) and a couple of diner-set two-handers with Megan Fox that scream, “We only have Bruce for the day.” Fox, though, carries her scenes as a rogue FBI agent whose sex-trafficking investigation dovetails with the search for a serial killer. The lone and fleeting bright spot is Welker White, a Scorsese veteran (Goodfellas, The Irishman), in a bracing bit of character work as the mother of one of the missing girls. But the shameless opening crib from Blood Simple (drawling about predators and prey, the narrator says, “Humans are the only creatures on Earth given a choice. I don’t know who said that, but I’m pretty sure they never imagined a place like Pensacola”) is unforgiveable.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckfzkzz7j002b3h679qcxuwev@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>26.

(Insert your own joke here.) Willis gets his John Wayne on as military adviser Colonel Jack Johnson, who whips Chinese aviators into fighting shape to take on the superior Japanese forces. At the 54-minute mark, Willis offers his squadron a pre-raid toast: “My father was a soldier as well. This is his watch. He said that if anything ever happened to him, he should give it to his son, and he did. This is his watch.” I know; Pulp Fiction, right? If Bruce Willis actually sneaked a Christopher Walken impression into a Chinese propaganda film, then he truly is, as one of the Chinese aviators anachronistically describes him, a badass.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cktomljk9000k3g70wcvry97f@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>25.&nbsp;Out of Death (2021)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cktomlsa1000o3g70zd3gv8c1@published data-word-count=103>No sooner does Jamie King venture into the woods to scatter her dead father’s ashes then she witnesses a crooked officer killing her partner in crime. Bruce, a 35-year veteran cop, has also come to this neck of the woods following the death of his wife for a little peace and quiet. Here, Bruce really doesn’t seem to give an actual fuck.

Jesse Metcalfe is top-billed as a mercenary who has a history with “the terrorist revolutionary who has been raising hell all over the globe.” Willis’s Donovan Chalmers gets one emotional scene with his daughter, who — not sure why — handed over the device to the Pardoner and has been taken prisoner along with dad.

Anna Hindman, as Brigit’s embittered sister, acquits herself nicely. Cigarettes, she scoffs, “ain’t gonna be what kills me.” And Bruce? He’s the sheriff, a “burned-out, washed-up disgrace to this town,” the lackey of a powerful businessman who calls the shots and wants Bruce to “neutralize” this increasingly suspicious situation.

The monkey in the wrench is Mack Carr (Patrick Muldoon), ex-Army Services, and currently a welder at the dam where his ex-wife works.

Bruce is the titular California city’s “only licensed detective.” The film ambles amiably for 40 minutes before the story proper kicks in: A drug dealer (an on-the-cusp-of-stardom Jason Momoa) takes Bruce’s beloved dog, forcing him to jump through increasingly absurd and dangerous hoops to get him back. John Goodman is his sad-sack best friend, a surf-shop owner in the throes of a divorce. Critics might call it a thankless role, but viewers are apt to thank the movie gods for Goodman’s welcome presence, especially in comparison to a maddeningly annoying Thomas Middleditch as Bruce’s awkward and bumbling protégé.
